# AI-Driven DevSecOps & Cloud Security Automation Platform

## Overview
This project simulates an enterprise-grade DevSecOps platform that integrates security controls directly into the CI/CD pipeline.  
It demonstrates how modern cloud-native teams embed security *by design*, not as an afterthought.

## Phase 4 Focus
DevSecOps & Cloud Security Automation

## Implemented Components (So Far)

### 1. Secure CI/CD Security Scans
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (Supply Chain Security)
- Container Image Security Scanning

### 2. Risk Gate (Policy-Based Decision Engine)
- Severity-based risk evaluation
- Pipeline decisions: PASS / WARN / FAIL
- Enterprise-aligned security thresholds

## Design Principles
- Shift-left security
- Risk-based decisions (not noise-based)
- Automation-first
- AI-ready structured outputs
- Interview-explainable architecture

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Bash
- GitHub Actions (to be wired)
- Docker & Kubernetes (later stages)
- JSON / YAML

## Status
🚧 In Progress — Pipeline orchestration and AI risk analysis coming next
